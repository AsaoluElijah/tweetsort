# TweetSort
A tool to sort through a user's tweets.

The reason I wish this existed is because I love lurking through the top of all time on Reddit. I want to provide that experience on Twitter.
There are so many talented and experienced people on the site sharing their expertise or even just humor. Twitter's ephemeral nature prevents us from seeing a user's
valuable input from the past. Search is great if you know the syntax for commands, but is also dependent on you as a user knowing what you're looking for.

I've found that users that thread a lot will resurface their own valuable tweets. What about users that don't do that? This tool seeks to enable people to seek out valuable past
tweets from people they want to learn more from.

I'm hoping to host this and have it available for people.

Challenges:
Getting all of a user's tweets (API only returns ~3,200 at a time)
Avoiding being rate limited
Keeping track of API calls
Protecting API keys
Storing data in cache to reduce calls to API
